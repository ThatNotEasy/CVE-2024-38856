## Features

- Scans targets for vulnerability using various paths
- Supports multithreading for faster processing
- Uses `coloredlogs` for color-coded, easy-to-read logs
- Supports input from a file containing a list of targets

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Python Modules:
  - `requests`
  - `coloredlogs`
  - `colorama`
  - `argparse`
  - `urllib3`

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requests coloredlogs colorama argparse urllib3
```

# Usage

## Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py [options]
```
# Options

- `-t`, `--threads`: Number of threads to use (default: 1)
- `-p`, `--port`: Target port
- `-c`, `--command`: Command to execute
- `-s`, `--scan`: Perform a scan with ping, curl, and wget
- `-d`, `--domain`: Domain (attacker domain) to scan with ping, curl, and wget
- `-f`, `--file`: File containing a list of targets in the format `http(s)://target,port`

# Examples

- Scan targets with a command:

  ```bash
  python script_name.py -f targets.txt -c "whoami"
  ```

 # Perform a scan with a domain:

```bash
python script_name.py -s -d example.com -p 80
```

# Use a file containing a list of targets:

```bash
python script_name.py -f targets.txt -c "uname -a"
```

# Error Handling
- If targets lack the http:// or https:// prefix, the script will prompt you to choose a prefix to add.
- If there's an error while making an HTTP request, the script will log the error.
